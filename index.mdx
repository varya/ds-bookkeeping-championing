<!--

My name is Varya. I work as a freelancer, and design systems are my
major focus. I started with libraries of components about 10 years ago,
before the term "design systems" even emerged.

By that time, my own understanding and the community's was more technical.
We were paying a lot of attention to how to code the components,
how to document them. Many new tools appeared since then.

Slightly by today, I changed my focus to more process and people oriented.
I realised that the biggest obstacle on the way is the gap between specialists:
designers and developers, product people and business people. In the meanwhile
I got a design education that helped me to see the picture at scale.

Nowadays, even though I am still doing a lot of hands-on and architectural frontend
work related to design systems, I shift to engineering&project management, educating,
and enganging people.

## What the talk is about
{ .story }

<style>{`

.story p {
  text-align: center;

.story img {
  margin-top: 2em;
  width: 325px;
}

`}</style>

<!--

This talk is a brief overview of how I mine the data about the design system
projects I am involved now. And how this data becomes the basis for the
decisions about the design system's near and distant future.

Due to NDA it was not possible that I share the exact data and screenshots of
the tools in use. So, I prepared the examples with imaginary data specifically
for this presentation. And the approach to the data should be quite general.
So, I hope that more people could kind of pull that to their own context.

-->


## How a design system team asked for more resources
{ .slide--shout .slide--highlighted }

### Based on a true story

<!--

Let me start with the story. The story is based on reality but the the
characters depicted are fictional and all the matches are random.

-->


## team and boss
{ .no-title }

<Cover src="pictures/it-crowd-team.jpeg" alt=""/>
<Cover className="next" src="pictures/it-crowd-boss.jpeg" alt=""/>

<!--
Once upon a time, a design system team realised that their
backlog is too large for them. They had a lot of great ideas but
not so much time to implement them. So they went to the money
guy and asked for more resources. Basically, they wanted that
the company opens a new position for their team, so that they can hire
an additional person.
They were sure that the addition is needed, especially for such a
great internal product as a design system.
-->


## Actually

* The value of design system is not clear
* Business has no idea what DS is doing
* DS team operates feelings not numbers

<!--
But it turned out that the money guy has different opinion. And it
was not a problem that their design system was bad, or they didn't
perform. In a nutshell, the thing was that the business had no idea
of what they were doing. Yeah, the company had a desing system
and even financed it because there was already a dedicated team for
it. But there was no proof of doing well. And even the design system
team itself only had feelings of what and how well they are doing.
Feelings, not knowledge supported with any data.
-->


## Growing from seed
{ .no-title }

<Cover src="pictures/seed.jpg" alt=""/>

<!--
That story happened to me personally. It is not exact but similar.
And actually it was years ago but it was the first push towards
my focus on measuring design systems. That finally grew into something
bigger.
-->

## Measuring a design system
{ .slide--shout .slide--highlighted }
### Why? What? How?

<!--
Measuring is a hot topic now. There is already very valuable articles
and talk about it that explain very well why measuring is important,
what and how we can measure.
When I started to work on this presentation, I was also thinking to
elaborate on these three questions: why? what? and how? I even made
30 or 40 slides. But perhaps these slides will be used at some other
time, bacause I asked myself a question "when?".
-->


## When?
{ .slide--shout .slide--primary }

<!--
When preparing the talk I recollected the story about asking for
more resources. It was actually a happy end. The position to the
design system team was opened and they hired whom they wanted.

Thinking of what happened then, how they convinced the business
people in the company, I realised the following.
-->


## Timeline
{ .no-title }

<div className="timeline">
  <div className="timeline__item timeline__item--position-2 next">
    <div className="timeline__item-name">present</div>
    <img className="timeline__item-icon" src="pictures/icon__question.png"/>
  </div>
  <div className="timeline__item timeline__item--position-1 next">
    <div className="timeline__item-name">past</div>
    <img className="timeline__item-icon" src="pictures/icon__parchment.png"/>
  </div>
  <div className="timeline__item timeline__item--position-3 next">
    <div className="timeline__item-name">future</div>
    <img className="timeline__item-icon" src="pictures/icon__puzzle.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

<!--

To get an idea of what we should do now, we
have to analyse our past and imagine what we aim
in the future.

When I strated with measuring, I did not expect where it brings me.
But finally it turned out that when we use data to bridge the past and
the future, it opens new perspectives in the present. New ways of working,
new focuses.

But let's see step by step.

## Measuring production costs
{ .slide--shout }

### to reflect, how easier (and more cost-effective) the life is for the projects

<Stamp title="past"/>

<!--
If we analyse our past, we can measure many things. One of the most obvious
metrics would be production costs. In short, how much money a design system
saves us.
-->


## Costs and savings

* Component is made only once 👍🏻
* Component needs to be integrated 👎🏻
* Component needs to be supported 👎🏻
* We support only one component 👍🏻

<!--
Re-using of the components definetely saves us design and development
time spent. But we cannot just multiply how many times the component
was used to its one-time costs and say that we saved that much money.

Using a design system costs too. We can work on decreasing these costs
but anyway we should say out load that linking a library of components
to the project also requires some work. Reading documentation costs time.
Possible bugs, repoting them, getting updates with fixes — that all forms
integration costs.

From design system team, they have to support. So, the more they are offering,
the more components they serve, the more is the support load.

But luckily we support only one component, thanks to the reuse.

-->


## Costs formula

### To make it once (in Design System)

```
$ = production time
    + (support costs * component lifetime)
    + (integration time * amount of projects)
```

### To make it many times

```
$ = (
    production time + (support costs * component lifetime)
  ) * amount of projects
```

<!--
-->

## Costs formula, whole system

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRS34KLVMHporg-AAxzVYbjXX2GS-DhgKDRUqk4EwiGNnXdow2DFg7EufwwUQj3_L_HV11Y83rJbmba/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

### Cost savings: 752 hours = 18.8 weeks = 4 months

## How to get the data?

* Survey
* Figma statistics / API
* GitHub Search / API
* Code analyzers

<!--
How exactly a team gets the data depends on many factors. Mostly,
on the shape of their organization and the tools they are using.

If code is stored on in some repository, say GitHub, it is possible to
obtain the data via search. In my recent project, we were using
a custom script that crawls across company's GitHub Enterprise and gets
all the needed data.

With Figma it is a bit more tricky. On Eternprise licenses there is
some statistics but if we need per component, it is not possible to
export automatically. Probably it can be done via Figma API but I haven't
checked. I consider it as a minor problem because these stats snapshots
are not needed every day. Once a month is already quite often, and we can
just manually re-write the numbers into some file where we store it.

You can always go with a simpliest version — just to run a survey, so that
people tell you what kind of components they use. This is already some data.
-->


## Measuring the past

### 1. Production costs
{ style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;" }

### 2. Availability of a design system
How easy to start? How fast are updates? Quality of documenttaion. Level
    of support needed.

### 3. Involvement and contributions
Design system's acceptance. Level of contributions.

<!--
Besides the production costs, it is possible to measure many other things
when looking to the past.
But keeping the context, let's already forward to the future.
-->


## Measuring the process of DS
{ .slide--shout}

### to reflect, how DS resources are used and if they correspond to the workload

<Stamp title="future"/>

<!--
As for the future, we can measure the processes in the design system. here
we examine how design system resources are used and if they correspond to 
the workload.
-->


## Workload estimation

### Learn backlog capacity
"Compund" number, can be obtained from JIRA, GitHub issues, etc.

### Apply given resources

<!--
The idea is quite straightforward. If we know what we would like to do,
and we know the given resources, we can prognose if the goal can be achieved.

Again, it is a good idea to use a task tracker. Because this way, the
workload becomes certain. Some teams that use the task trackers on an advanced
level can even automatically estimate.
-->

Making design systems successful is just as much about creating a people system as it is about creating a technical or operational one.
