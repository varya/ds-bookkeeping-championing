## Measuring a design system
{ .slide--shout .slide--highlighted }
### Why? What? How?


## Why to measure?

* Design system needs to prove its business value to the upper levels. If this value is measurable, it can result into better management of resources.
* Design system team needs confirmation if they are doing the right thing.
* Design system team needs to correct its plans according to instant measurements and dynamic picture. 

## Valuable for different levels

* (B) Measuring business value
  What is important for the business levels to know
* (P) Measuring system-project interactions
  How good the design system is for its users
* (I) Internal measuring
  Workload, internal costs, etc


## What exactly you can measure?

| What?         | Why?       | How? 
| ---              | ---         | ---       
| Brand |         |      
| Production costs     |  | 
| Availability of the design system | | 
| Involvement and contributions        |  | 
| Quality of DS        |  | 
| The process        |  | 


## Measuring production costs

### to reflect, how easier (and more cost-effective) the life is for the projects

## Plain text on your slides

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur [adipisicing](#4) elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, _quis nostrud_ exercitation ullamco laboris __nisi ut aliquip__ ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure *dolor* in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum **dolore** eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in ```<culpa>``` qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Two columns if you like (or three, or four)

<Columns col="2">

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation.

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia.

</Columns>

## All kind of lists

1. Simple lists are marked with bullets
1. Ordered lists begin with a number
1. You can even nest lists one inside another
    * Or mix their types
    * But do not go too far
    * Otherwise audience will be bored
1. Look, seven rows exactly!

## Serious citations

## Code samples 1: simple code block with markdown syntax

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head> <!--Comment-->
    <title>Shower</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css">
</head>
```

## Code samples 2: Code component and custom jsx to highlight lines of code

<Code>
  {`<!DOCTYPE html>`}
  <code className="mark">{`  <html lang="en">`} </code>
  <mark>{`  <head> <!--Comment-->`}</mark>
  {`     <title>Shower</title>`}
  {`   <meta charset="UTF-8">`}
  {`   <link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css">`}
  <mark>{`<title>Shower</title>`}</mark>
</Code>

## Even tables can be made in markdown.

| Locavore         | Umami       | Helvetica | Vegan
| ---              | ---         | ---       |---
| **Fingerstache** | Kale        | Chips     | Keytar
| **Sriracha**     | Gluten-free | Ennui     | Keffiyeh
| **Thundercats**  | Jean        | Shorts    | Biodiesel
| **Terry**        | Richardson  | Swag      | Blog

It’s good to have information organized.
